# Weather-App
My name is Shanton and this is my Weather app

The purpose of a weather app is to provide users with accurate and timely weather information, helping them make informed decisions about their daily activities. Weather apps can offer various features such as:
Current Weather Conditions: Displaying the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.
Forecast: Providing detailed forecasts for the next few hours, days, or weeks, including information on precipitation, temperature, and wind pattern
